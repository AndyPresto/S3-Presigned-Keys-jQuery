# S3-Presigned-Keys-jQuery

Built upon the starter ASP.NET Core 3 MVC template, this is an example project showing a possible way to generate S3 presigned keys using the AWS SDK for .NET/C# and upload files to S3 using a jQuery frontend.

A full tutorial can be found on my blog at [andyp.dev](https://andyp.dev/posts/generate-aws-s3-presigned-keys-in-c-for-jquery-frontend).

## Running the app
Open the app in Visual Studio and then debug the solution. Remember to add your own AWS IAM authentication credentials and the S3 bucket name to S3.cs.
